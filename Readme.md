In this project i wrote a python program that can process spreadsheets, this is extremely valuable
in situation where we have hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets that need to be updated.If we want to do this by hand it may take hours or days
weeks, or even months, you can simply build a python program in less then half an hour. So, here i woked on ------ excel spreadsheet. 
In this spreadsheet there are three columns, transaction ID, product ID, and press. So in this spreadsheet i am going to record all kinds of transactions
, but let's say due to an error, it could be a human error or a system error, the price that i have
here is wrong. Let's we need to decrease this by 10 percent. If we want to do this manually, we'll have to come back to the spreadsheet and
add a formula, we need to get to the cell then multiply it by 0.9 and that is like 90% of the original price, we are reducing the original
reducing the price by 10%.and recalculate the value of this cell.
have to get that and then multiply it by 0.9 and that is like 90% of the original price, we are reducing the original
reducing the price by 10%. Next we have to apply the same formula to all the other rows. Now what if we have thousands of rows here?
we have to scroll up and down, this is going to be very tedious.
So i wrote a python program that will do this for us.
